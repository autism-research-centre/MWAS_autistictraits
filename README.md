# MWAS_autistictraits

The scripts provided here have been used to conduct a methylome-wide association study of autistic traits in 701 8-year olds. Autistic traits were measured using SCDC scores in the ARIES cohort. In addition, we also conducted enrichment analysis to investigate enrichment with GWAS signals.


Methylation data was provided by ALSPAC, after data request.
